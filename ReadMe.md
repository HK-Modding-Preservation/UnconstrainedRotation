# UnconstrainedRotation

The knight normally has its rotation locked to remain upright. Well not anymore!

## A few quirks you should know about
- Spells, nail, dream nail, etc. will match the knight's rotation but will retain their upright effects
	- A right slash will always knock enemies to the right, even if the slash hitbox is to the left of you
	- A pogo will always push you upwards, even if the slash hitbox is above or beside you
	- A VS cast will go in the direction you are moving (like normal) but may often hit the ground immediately if you're lying down
- Getting off of a bench will set you upright, but there's a good chance it will also put you below the floor
- Clinging to a wall is a semi-reliable way to align yourself
- Walking onto or off of a ledge will almost always cause some rotation
	- This can include going through transitions
- Say goodbye to corner-correcting, now you just spin violently, even during cdashes or dives
